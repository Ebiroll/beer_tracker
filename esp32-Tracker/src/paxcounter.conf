* Scan duration sets how long scanning should be going on, interrupting a wifi scan cycle.
* Scan window sets how much of the interval should be occupied by scanning.
* Scan interval is how long scanning should be done on each channel. BLE uses 3 channels for advertising.
* -> Adjust these values with power consumption in mind if power is limited.
